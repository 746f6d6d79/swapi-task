Create Node.js API (REST or GraphQL) with features:
1. Provide endpoints to return resources:
a. films - should return all films
b. species - same, but species
c. vehicles - same, but vehicles
d. starships - same, but starships
e. planets - same, but planets
Endpoints should provide an option to paginate (check API results, page size doesnâ€™t
have to be controlled) and filter returned data.
2. Users can also get resources, through API, with a specific id.
3. Cache mechanism - every resource pulled from the Star Wars API should be cached
for 24 hours. Every next request for a specific resource should firstly check if it exists
in the cache. If so, the server should return the object from the cache instead of
requesting the Star Wars API. Utilize the chosen database for this task.
4. Each film entry returned from the /films/ API has an opening_crawl property which
contains a short film plot description. Write an endpoint that will return:
A. an array of pairs of unique words from all films openings paired with their
number of occurrences in the text. Words should not be empty and should be
separated by space or any number of consecutive control characters (i.e
carriage return, line feed).
B. a name of a character from the /people API that appears the most often
across all of the openings of the film (or an array of names if there are more
characters with the same number). We are interested only in exact name
matches excluding eventual control characters in between when the name is
longer than a single word.

5. At least some parts of the application should be appropriately tested. The tests can
either use real API or mocked responses. Tests code should be clean and
non-redundant.
6. Every endpoint should be well documented. You should choose the appropriate form
of documentation yourself.
7. Developers should be able to run API on their local environment with Docker
Compose.
